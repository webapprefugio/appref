## Municipal Brazilian Geodata

This repository contains the municipal boundaries of all Brazilian municipalities. The data is divided by states, which are named by it's code. For example, Minas Gerais state data is at `MG.json` file.

There's two sets of data available: the raw GeoJSON data (located at `data` directory) and the minified version of it (located at `minified` directory).

## Issues / Pull Requests
